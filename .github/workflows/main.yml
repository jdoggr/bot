        # Example deployment commands (you'll need to customize based on your host)
        # 1. Deploy to Heroku, Render, DigitalOcean, etc.
        # 2. If you're deploying to a VM, use SSH commands to push your code

        # Example using Heroku CLI:
        # heroku login
        # git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/your-app.git
        # git push heroku main

        # Alternatively, use specific deployment scripts based on your hosting service
        echo "Deploying your app..." # Add specific deployment commands here
